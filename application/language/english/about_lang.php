All competitors are required to submit a Technical Request Form 
The deadline for Technical Request is March 6th  2015. After that date contestants are only
guaranteed a static basic light, without cues.
This document will help to guide you when you fill out the form.
We urge you to send in the form as soon as possible, the earlier we receive your form, the more
time we have to communicate with you to avoid misunderstandings. Our team will do our best to
give you the best possible competition service and the Technical Request Form is a very important tool for us and for you.
Please attach a photo of your act to this form.
If you have any questions or additional information please feel free to email us: dani_magix@yahoo.com <br> 

Final deadline for Technical Request Form: March 13th 2015 !!! <br><br>


<b><u>General Information</u></b><br><br>

You only send in one form, in the name of one of the competitors, even if you are two or several
persons in your act. The other persons are named in the section “Additional act members”.
We strongly advise that you also bring your own technical assistants. They can help you setting your props on stage,
 giving cues sitting beside the Sound Engineer or the Light Engineer, helping out with translation and represent your 
 act in different aspects (E.G. sound, light, props) during the rehearsal.
You name these assistants under the section “Off Stage Assistants”.
It is essential for the success of the competition to bring down set up times to a minimum. Please
rehearse and organize your set up and clean up in the most effective way possible.
Your act has a lot to lose if the audience “turns cold” because they have to wait long before you
enter the stage. Please indicate your normal set up time in seconds. If you have a clean up time that is exceptionally 
long please indicate in the last section “Additional Information”<br><br>	

<b><u>Sound Equipment</u></b><br>

<ul>
	<li>Stand Microphone</li>
	<li>Head Set Microphone</li>
	<li>CD Player</li>
</ul><br>

All music and sound effects shall be recorded on one single CD, kept in its case and
both disc and case must be clearly marked with the performers name. If your cue sheet contains
more than 2 cues (music on, music off) it is necessary that a person representing your act is present in the 
sound control room to give proper cues, If you copy your music on a CD, it is advisable to burn the CD at minimum speed,
 using a high quality writable CD. Please check that the CD is accepted with several CD players.
It is also advisable to bring a back up file, on a device that can be plugged into a computer (USB
Memory Stick, MP3 Player with computer connection, data CD) in case of emergency to make a
duplicate CD. We will have a computer and staff to assist you with this.
If you want to use other audio visual apparatus E.G. video projector and/or DVD player you must explain in details.<br><br>

<b><u>Remote Controlled Equipment</u></b><br><br>

You are only allowed to use remote controlled equipment if it does not interfere with sound, light
and other technical equipment on and off stage.<br><br>

<b><u>Props</u></b><br><br>

We assume that you bring you own props. If requested in advance, we can supply the following:
ordinary chair, smoke machine, electricity (220 V/2000W) centre stage, stage left or stage right, extension cables.<br>
<b><u>Music Cues</u></b><br><br>

Please note that should you need music cues, other than “start” when the curtain opens and “stop”
when the curtain closes, you must provide a cueing assistant at the mixer board.<br><br>

<b><u>Stage</u></b><br><br>";

The stage size is 10 metres wide, 9 metres deep and 7 metres high.
It is not allowed to fix anything to this floor (no nails, no screws, no tape and no glue). Props should be fitted not 
to damage the floor. Competitors will be charged for any damage to the floor.
The nine light spots 1-9 will be marked on the stage (see stage plan) and these markings could be used for 
reference, for instance when placing out props. No other markings are permitted on the floor.
The Preparation Area is located stage right. Only the next act will be permitted in this area.
The Load Out Area is located stage left. You must be out of here before the following act is finished.
You will set up your props in the Preparation Area adjacent to the stage, during the performance of the act before you.
 There will be 2 stage hands available to assist you and to help you carry on and off your props. You will have less
  than 10 minutes to bring your props from the dressing room backstage to the Preparation Area. Larger props
   (stage illusions etc) can be brought to the stage area already during the intermission. After the performance,
    your props will be brought to the Load Out Area, on the other side of the stage. From there you must take your
     props to the dressing room area during the performance of the act following yours.<br><br>



<b><u>Stage Light</u></b><br>

<b>General information – please read carefully:</b><br><br>

All competitors must use the standard lighting plan. 
detailed information, please use the simple form. If you want to specify colour numbers, light intensity,
etc, you can use the advanced form instead. You must fill out one of the forms if you want to have any
influence on your stage light.
The stage light can light up three different areas on the stage,1-3 front,4-6 middle,7-9 back.
 When you fill out the Light Form it is essential that you fill in the
field (Area:) with the correct numbers srom 1 to 9.
You can have up to five different light cues. In addition to this, there is an option of a black out at the
 start and the end of the act. Please note that all light changes, also blackouts – except from the two mentioned 
 above – will count as new cues and be included in the total of five cues.
There are two pre-programmed light effects – a ”disco effect” and a light suitable for acts using
invisible thread. 
There is also one follow spot, which may be operated only by the technical staff.
It is not possible to use moving lights, or to make individual changes to the pre-programmed effects.
If there are many, essential or very special light changes during your act, we advise you to provide an assistant 
to give the cues in the light control room during the competition. Please bear in mind that the run-through time
 for rehearsal allowed for each act is only 5 minutes.
When you fill in the Light form, please describe the mood or ambience of your act (i. e. ”romantic” ”spooky”
 ”sunrise” ”playful”...). Please also specify in which area you will be performing (1-9). If there are light 
changes during your act, please number each atmosphere 1-5, and specify when the light changes occur. (e.g. light 
	change comes when magician produces a red shoe). <br><br>

<b><u>Fire and Special Effects</u></b><br><br>

The use of fire on stage is prohibited unless you have applied for and received special permission. If you are 
allowed to use fire, the fire must be lit and extinguished on stage. You are never allowed to transport burning
 objects from or to the stage.
Please note that any use of fire, flammable materials, smoke or pyrotechnics not mentioned in the
Technical Requests Form and clearly approved by stage competition manager is strictly forbidden and may cause
 the stage manager to decide to end your performance before it is finished.<br><br>	

<b><u>Staff</u></b><br><br>

You are allowed and we really encourage that you bring your own stage assistants, especially if you have large 
or complicated props on stage or if you have more than two music cues or complicated light cues. However you must 
mention the name of your assistants in the Technical Request Form. They will be supplied with back stage passes for
 the time of your rehearsals and shows.<br><br>

<b><u>Rehearsal</u></b><br><br>

A run through of your act will take place on Friday March 29th from 12:00. You will receive a schedule 
for this in advance. Each competitor must be present for this run through. The run through for each act must
 not exceed 5 minutes. After 5 minutes an alarm will sound and the run through is ended. Everything concerning 
your act must be discussed and arranged at this run through. There is no other rehearsal time available and you 
are not allowed to discuss your act and requirements with the technical staff at any other occasion.
Once your run through or performance is completed, you must leave the stage area as quickly as
possible, leaving no props in the stage area. Back stage area must be cleared before the end of the
day.
To ensure the best possible result, here are some suggestions:
Rehearse your act at home, but also rehearse the rehearsal! Check the best way to transfer all
relevant information in only 5 minutes. It helps a lot if you fill in the cue lists and other
information on the Technical Request Form as clearly as possible. Make sure that you cover the
following items during your run through:<br>
1. See the light situations you have ordered and explain the light cues as clearly as possible.<br>
2. Bring costumes and props (E.G. jacket and invisible thread) that are essential for lighting to
the run through <br>
3. Check that your sound media is accepted by the sound equipment.<br>
4. Explain sound cues clearly.<br>
5. Explain curtain cues.<br>
6. State if you enter stage left or stage right.<br>
7. Explain the prop handling to the stage hands.<br>
8. Explain special effect cues and the use of fire clearly.<br>
The run through is carried out in English. You can bring a translator if you like. You may also bring people 
assisting you with the rehearsal and performance. This also applies for cue assistants for sound and light.
 Remember that if the information you provide in the Technical Request Form is accurate and detailed, you are 
 more likely to actually get what you want.<br><br>
